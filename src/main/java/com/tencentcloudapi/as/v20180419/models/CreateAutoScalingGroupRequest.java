<br><li>EQUALITY: instances created for scale-out are distributed to multiple availability zones/subnets, so as to keep the number of instances in different availability zone/subnet in balance.

Notes: 
<br><li> When the scaling group is based on the classic network, this policy applies to multiple availability zones. When the scaling group is based on a VPC, this policy applies to multiple subnets, and you do not need to consider availability zones. For example, if you have four subnets (A, B, C, and D) and A, B, and C are in availability zone 1 and D is in availability zone 2, you only need to decide the order of the four subnets, without worrying about the issue of availability zones.
<br><li> This policy is applicable to multiple availability zones/subnets, but is not applicable to multiple models with launch configurations. Specify the models according to the model priority.
<br><li> When creating instances based on the PRIORITY policy, apply the multi-model policy and then apply the multi-availability zones/subnet policy. For example, if you have models A and B and subnets 1, 2, and 3, creation will be attempted in the following order: A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, and B3. If A1 is sold out, A2 (not B1) is tried next.
